# Capstone Project: Vista Voyages

**Theme:** Travel Agency Website  
**Created By:** Nishtha Sharma

## Project Overview
Vista Voyages is a fully responsive, static website designed for a travel agency. It showcases popular tour packages, agency benefits, and a booking inquiry form. The design focuses on clean semantic HTML5 and modern CSS3 styling.

## Features & Sections
1.  **Header:** Sticky navigation bar with a responsive hamburger menu for mobile.
2.  **Hero Section:** Full-width background image with overlay text and a call-to-action button featuring a fade-up animation.
3.  **Packages (Grid):** A responsive grid displaying tour cards with images, prices, and hover effects.
4.  **About Us (Flexbox):** A side-by-side layout of text and image explaining the company's value proposition.
5.  **Contact Form:** A stylized form for booking inquiries with properly labeled inputs.
6.  **Footer:** Contains site links, social media icons (SVG), and copyright info.

## Technical Details
*   **Semantic HTML:** Uses `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` tags.
*   **CSS Grid:** Used for the "Popular Destinations" card layout (`grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, ...)`).
*   **Flexbox:** Used for the navigation bar, footer alignment, and the About section layout.
*   **Responsiveness:**
    *   **Desktop:** Full horizontal navigation and multi-column layouts.
    *   **Tablet (<768px):** Navigation collapses into a hamburger menu; About section stacks vertically.
    *   **Mobile (<480px):** Grid becomes single column; font sizes adjust for readability.
*   **Variables:** CSS variables (`:root`) used for consistent color theming (Teal/Coral).

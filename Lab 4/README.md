# Browser Console JavaScript Quiz

This project is a simple JavaScript quiz game that runs entirely within the web browser's developer console. It demonstrates core JavaScript concepts including arrays, loops, conditionals, functions, and user input/output handling.

## Features
- **Interactive:** Uses `prompt()` to ask questions and `alert()` to provide feedback.
- **Case Insensitive:** Inputs are processed using `.toLowerCase()` and `.trim()` so "Paris", "paris ", and "PARIS" are all accepted as correct.
- **Score Tracking:** Calculates and displays the user's score at the end of the game.
- **Pure JavaScript:** No HTML or DOM manipulation required.

## How to Run
1. Open any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
2. Open the **Developer Console**:
   - **Windows/Linux:** Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + J`.
   - **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Option + J`.
3. Copy the code from `quiz.js`.
4. Paste the code into the console area.
5. Press `Enter`.
6. The quiz will start immediately.

## Learning Outcomes
This assignment demonstrates mastery of:
- **Arrays & Objects:** Storing structured data.
- **Loops:** Iterating through question sets.
- **Functions:** Encapsulating game logic.
- **Input Validation:** Sanitizing user text input.
